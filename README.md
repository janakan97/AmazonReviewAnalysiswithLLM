# AmazonReviewAnalysiswithLLM
The present project experimentally investigated using a performance Large Language Model(LLM) to analyze Amazon's review dataset, in which the prompt was developed to perform sentimental analysis. The study was performed on 5000 datasets, which were sliced from the original dataset, which was 34000 in size. This project focuses on identifying a suitable LLM model for the requirement of sentimental analysis and model performance. The LLM model's performance is analyzed by comparing the consistent dataset with the models of the traditional machine learning model like Random Forest and Naive Bayes. For analysis of both the models, the dataset is text. All the necessary text wrangling and vectorization has been performed on the data using the library nltk and spacy. This project is an eye opener to the team in the performance of sentimental analysis and the comparison.![image](https://github.com/janakan97/AmazonReviewAnalysiswithLLM/assets/36205745/0c6d5321-7d99-4005-a528-60ec23ac6ec6)
